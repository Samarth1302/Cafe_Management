This is a Next.js, GraphQL project made for streamlining operations of a Cafe in terms of food ordering, order processing, status updates and dashboard for tracking sales of food items. The live deployment has been stopped. The GraphQL functions and controllers are a perfect example of using latest Apollo Server and Client utilities for GraphQL API's.
